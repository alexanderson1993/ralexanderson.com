In Sunday School, a teacher told the story of her teenage daughter. Anyone who has been that age will get this. At some point during her high school career, something didn’t go as planned. Maybe she didn’t do so well on a test, or perhaps she didn’t get asked to the spring formal. Regardless, she was devastated. It was as if the entire world was over - her life could not go on, and nothing mattered.

Obviously that was not the case. While empathetic and compassionate, her mother reminded her that she did indeed have a lot of life left to live. What she was going through wouldn’t last too long and she would make it through. Her mother knew because she had been there. She knew what it was like, but she also knew that now, twenty years later, it didn’t matter. Of course, her mother has her own worries and concerns, but you know what? In twenty years, those probably won’t matter either. (And for the pessimist and Queen fans, add enough years and nothing matters anyway! It does, of course, but that is what Faith is for.)

I think we all get a little paralyzed at times. We cannot see the end from the beginning, so it is hard for us to move forward or move on. That said, I cannot think of a single time when my life ended because something didn’t work out.

I am reminded of a man who had lost his family, his company, his reputation, and his soberness. Standing on the precipice, looking down to his doom, he wondered if his life had any meaning. With that thought, he realized that with nothing left, he has no constraints and no restrictions. He could move on and do amazing things with no risks, because what did he have to lose? That man was Buckminster Fuller, and he went on to become an amazing chemical researcher.

So, when things don’t work out, remember that you can’t see the future. You might be surprised at what you still have in store.

Cheers!
