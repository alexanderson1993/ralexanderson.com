# Overview of React

<Notes>
  Concurrent mode touches a lot on the internals of React, so we're going to do
  a bit of a dive into how React works under the hood.
</Notes>

---

# `v = f(s)`

<Notes>
  React works on a simple principle: Your view is a function of your state. The
  view is what you see in the browser; your DOM nodes. State is data that is
  inserted into the function at different points through user input, network
  requests, and the like. The function is the React code that us developers
  write.
</Notes>

# Virtual <del>DOM</del> Tree

![Virtual DOM](/concurrent-mode/virtual-dom.svg)

<Notes>
  One of the biggest innovations of React is the virtual dom. It is a misnomer,
  since it doesn't map exactly to the dom and applies to more than just DOM
  renderers, like React Native. For this talk, I'll just call it the Virtual
  DOM. What it does is take our functions and state and display the appropriate
  output in two steps.
</Notes>

---

# Render Phase

![Render Phase](/concurrent-mode/render-phase.svg)

<Notes>
  The render phase is the part that executes our code. When our app first
  executes, it creates a virtual representation of the output of our code. This
  is the virtual DOM.
</Notes>

---

# Commit Phase

![Commit Phase](/concurrent-mode/commit-phase.svg)

<Notes>
  The commit phase takes the virtual representation of our app and performs the
  necessary actions to reflect it on the DOM. For the first render, it just
  outputs it wholesale. For every subsequent render, it compares the virtual DOM
  to the actual DOM and surgically updates the DOM, limiting the number of
  updates needed. This was the original selling point of React.
</Notes>

---

# Render Blocking

![Render Blocking](/concurrent-mode/time-slicing.gif)

https://react-timeslicing-demo.netlify.com/

<Notes>
  There was a problem with the original implementation, though. It's a problem
  inherent in JavaScript. You can only execute one thread at a time, which means
  your renders can become blocked by long-running execution. This gif shows
  entering text in an input field being blocked by a heavy calculation, making
  the UI janky. We have to get around this with debounces. That solves the
  problem, but could it be better?
</Notes>

# Async Waiting

## Count the Placeholders

![Loading Placeholder](/concurrent-mode/placeholder.gif)

https://twitter.com/acdlite/status/991503599246098432

<Notes>
  There are also improvements that can be made to loading. If you take a look at
  this Facebook ad manager page, there are all kinds of loading spinners on
  there, coming in and leaving as data is requested and eventually loaded. It's
  a mess. It's possible to use fancy JavaScript to orchestrate all of these
  components coming and going, but certainly there is a simpler way.
</Notes>

# Fiber

- Pause work and come back to it later.
- Assign priority to different types of work.
- Reuse previously completed work.
- Abort work if it's no longer needed.

<Notes>
  The React Fiber rewrite was completed in 2017 with the goal of making it
  easier to solve some of these issues while adding new features (Yay error
  boundaries!). Fiber was a crucial step towards making Concurrent mode
  possible, since React needed the ability to shift around units of work as data
  requirements and priorities changed.
</Notes>

---

# How Fiber works

![Fiber](/concurrent-mode/fiber.png)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCuYPiUIONs

<Notes>
  Fiber is able to get around the single-threaded nature of JavaScript by
  breaking the app tree out into individual components. Each of these components
  is an isolated function, a unit of work. When the app re-renders, the
  components that need to be evaluated are added to a queue and processed one at
  a time in a non-blocking way. Then, when some kind of change happens, such as
  a high-priority update or a thrown error, the queue is re-ordered so the
  urgent change is reflected. Since the rendering method is non-blocking, if the
  priority queue changes, React can... React to that and process only what needs
  to be rendered.
</Notes>

# Unsafe Class Methods

- UNSAFE_componentWillMount
- UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate
- UNSAFE_componentWillRecieveProps

<Notes>
  This does mean that compnents might be executed multiple times before they are
  finally committed to the dom. That's why these class lifecycle methods are
  unsafe. We can no longer count on them executing in a predictable way. We can
  still use them, but sometimes they might be executed twice before the
  component even hits the page, which might mean multiple network requests are
  fired or unexpected things happen to our component's state. This is why these
  class methods are now labeled 'unsafe'. Avoid using them.
</Notes>

# Concurrent Mode

- Opt-in
- Interruptable Rendering, or Time Slicing
- Intentional Loading Sequences, or Suspense
- More opinionated (but for the better)

<Notes>
  That said, if you follow the rules, you get a lot of great benefits from
  Concurrent mode. This is a special new mode of React, currently only available
  in an experimental build, that you will opt into to activate concurrent super
  powers in your app. This includes interruptable rendering, or Time Slicing,
  which is enabled by default and should work out of the box. Intentional
  loading sequences, or Suspense, is a bit more nuanced and requires more
  attention from library authors and developers. However, with enough care and
  attention, it can help you create great user experiences and even improve your
  developer experience. Also, with all of these new features, the React team has
  built subtle opinions into the framework that affect how things are displayed.
</Notes>

# Demos

- Enabling Concurrent Mode
- Time Slicing
- Suspense for Data Fetching
- SuspenseList
- useTransition

<Notes>Let's look at some demos that show off how Concurrent mode works.</Notes>

# More Features

- Streaming SSR & prioritized hydration
- Render while you Fetch
- Prerendering
- useDeferredValue
- Scheduler Primitives

<Notes>
  Concurrent mode gives us even more features that I can't demo today. Streaming
  SSR and prioritized hydration allow you to stream markup and code to browsers
  as it's being server-side rendered, giving priority to areas of the page which
  the user is trying to interact with. This improves Time to First Paint and
  Time To Interactive metrics. Rendering while you fetch is a pattern that also
  improves how the page is loaded by avoiding waterfall dependency loading. You
  can also pre-render and preload components without affecting the UI. By
  placing those components at a lower priority, the rest of the page will render
  before React even touches them. Then when it has time, it will load and render
  those components so they appear quickly when needed. useDeferredValue is a new
  built-in hook that allows you to better orchestrate Suspense behaviors to keep
  the UI fast while data is loading, and scheduler primitives allow you to
  specifically say which updates are important and which are lower priority.
</Notes>

# Most of this will be handled by library authors

<Notes>
  The good news is a lot of these things will automatically be handled by
  library authors. All you have to do is enable concurrent mode and use
  compatible libraries.
</Notes>

---

# Pitfalls

- String Refs
- Legacy Context
- ReactDOM.findDOMNode
- UNSAFE class methods

<Notes>
  As I mentioned before, there are things that prohibit you from using
  Concurrent mode. Those include string refs, using legacy context, the
  ReactDOM.findDOMNode method, and unsafe class methods.
</Notes>

---

# React.StrictMode

- No impact on Production
- Checks for Pitfalls
- Double-invokes lifecycle methods to surface side-effect bugs

<Notes>
  There is a built-in React component called Strict Mode which you can wrap
  around your component tree, or even parts of the tree, to have React tell you
  what problems it discovers. This can help you prepare to activate Concurrent
  mode. You absolutely should start using this component right away, even if
  there are many problems that can't be solved right away.
</Notes>

---

# Blocking Mode

![Feature Comparison](/concurrent-mode/features.png)

<Notes>
  There is a intermediary blocking mode which you can enable which gives you
  some of the benefits of concurrent mode without being too unsafe. This is a
  good way to get started as you begin migrating your app to concurrent mode.
</Notes>

# Just Use Hooks

> Since then we’ve completed related work, such as the new Context API and the introduction of Hooks, which are designed in part to help developers naturally write code that is more compatible with Concurrent Mode.

  </a>
</small>

<Notes>
  Also, if you start using React Hooks, you can prepare to take advantage of
  useTransition and useDeferredValue, as well as avoid problems that might come
  with unsafe class methods. Hooks were literally designed to help you avoid the
  pitfalls of concurrent mode. Writing in hooks will help you not write bugs
  that are easy to write with class components.

# It's Just React

> React Fiber is just React. React Suspense is just React. Concurrent Mode is just React. These monikers are useful to explain where we’re going and to refer to a feature before it ships. But they’re designed to fade away.

<Notes>
  An important thing to remember is this isn't a special new kind of React that
  runs in parallel of the old React. It's the same React, just with new powers.
  The plan is for all React apps to run in Concurrent mode eventually. And I'm
  sure that once that happens, there will be even more improvements and benefits
  that the React team can make.
</Notes>

# When can I use Concurrent Mode?

- Currently experimental
- Only use Concurrent Mode compatible libraries. isn't Concurrent mode ready
- Make sure your app is ready
  - Use React.StrictMode
  - Use Hooks

<Notes>
  At Instructure, we can't use InstUI yet. It's still experimental, and they
  strongly recommend not using it in production. Also, make sure your app,
  libraries and dependencies are concurrent mode compatible. You can check this
  with React.StrictMode. Also, using hooks will help you avoid a host of
  problems that might come with Concurrent mode.
