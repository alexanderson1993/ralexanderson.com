<Notes>
  This idea isn't new. It's been around for as long as React - how can we
  compose our stateful logic the same way we compose our UI components? Hooks
  allows you to do that.

  Here's a component with a couple of pieces. It's kind of hard to see what all
  is going on here. It looks like they use a ThemeContext consumer render prop
  down here, an event listener for the window resizing, and a bit of state for
  storing the name. There's a lot of stuff going on here. I'm going to highlight
  the sections of the component that deal with those particular parts of
  functionality.

  Wow. You've got things mixed together all over the place. Some components
  won't look so bad, but I'm sure many complex components will look a lot worse.
  What if we were to take those disperate functions and separate them into their
  own hooks.

<Notes>
  When it comes to separation of concerns, this is where Hooks really shine.
  Instead of spreading your component state and logic between a bunch of
  disperate lifecycle methods and constructors, you can put the entire logic for
  a particular function inside a hook. Then, just include that hook. This also
  allows you to reuse the hook in other components that might need it or compose
  it with other hooks.

# What are the Hooks?

- `useState`
- `useEffect`
- `useContext`
- `useRef`
- `useReducer`
- `useMemo`
- `useCallback`
