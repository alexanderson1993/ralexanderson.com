[Give this one a good read.](http://bryce.vc/post/122199637090/ferraris-dont-grow-on-trees) It's a quick read, but shows how important, how valuable it is to do things for yourself. Nowadays, it's dead simple to get someone to do anything for you for a price. Is it worth it, even if you have the money? What are some of the unexpected consequences of putting your work onto someone else?

Cheers!
