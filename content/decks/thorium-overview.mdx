# Hypercard

It Builds Character™

- Peer-to-peer communication
- Stacks & Cards
- Kind of hacky, but very stable

# Livecode

Revolution

- Like Hypercard, only fancier!
- TCP/IP networking instead of AppleTalk
- Data was still local to the client, still peer-to-peer
- Easy to learn!

# Lessons Learned

- Simple is effective - it gets the job done
- Teachable & Learnable > Powerful & Performant
- You don't know what you don't know until you know better

---

# Cocoa

Mercury - The Future

- Central database
- "Cards" are now atomic - can be distributed
- Mac only - sorry

# Flint

Designed for the USS Voyager

---

# The Goals

- Integrated Audio & Sound Effects
- Software controlled lighting
- Multi-channel, multi-room Audio
- Dynamic, automated viewscreen
- Built-in Voice Changer
- Panel Integration

---

![/panel.jpg](/panel.jpg)

---

- First Web-based simulator Controls
- Built with MeteorJS
- Innovative, ambitious, but not effective
- Never Completed

(No screenshots. You'll see them soon. 😉)

---

# Lessons Learned

- "Skunkworks" are interesting, but it's okay to throw out useless innovation
- Burnout is real - make sure you focus on DX and UX
- Rule by committee is slow, tiresome progress
- Don't get tied down by your framework

---

# Thorium

![/logo.png](/logo.png)

---

# Thorium

- Built with React, GraphQL, <del>Elixir</del>, <del>Docker</del>, <del>RethinkDB</del>, Node
- Learn first, market & distribute later (I kept it secret)
- Build a team to work on it with me
- First open-source simulator controls (https://github.com/thorium-sim/thorium)
- Finish the dang controls (Flint still hurt 😥)

---

# Standing on the Shoulders of Giants

- Composable Cards like Mercury
- Build in effects controls like Flint
- Design for configurability - make it work for any ship
- Multiple layouts and themes so ships look unique

---

# Innovate

- Fly flights, not ships
- Power to the Flight Director
- Automated Mission Timeline
- Core Feed - Actionable Notifications

---

# What Happened

- Started in June 2016
- Went public June 2017
- Began full-scale in-simulator testing October 2017

---

# What Happened

- Running in the Lions Gate Center January 2018
- Committment to run at the Christa McAuliffe Space Center May 2018
- Running in the Discovery Space Center June 2018
- Running in the Telos Space Center June 2018
- Running in the Renassance Space Academy September 2018

# Lessons Learned

- Side projects are AWESOME for learning new stuff.
- Build your team from the get-go. Later might be too late.
- Making enterprise/configurable software is tough.
- Being dictator of your projects is REALLY nice...

---

# Lessons Learned

- ...but it can get lonely. 😔
- If you want customers/users, get your stuff in front of them ASAP
- Customers know better than anyone what the product should do.
- But they'll tell you (if you let them) ->
