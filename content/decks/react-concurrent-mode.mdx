- Overview of React
  - Virtual DOM
  - Reconciler
    - Render Phase
    - Commit Phase
  - Blocking Rendering
  - Fiber

  - Concurrent Mode
    - Interruptable Rendering
    - Intentional Loading Sequences
    - Concurrently work on several state updates at the same time
      - CPU-Bound: More urgent updates interrupt Rendering
      - IO-Bound: Render UIs in-memory before data arrives.
    - More opinionated
  - Show Feature Comparison (https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-adoption.html#feature-comparison) and then highlight the parts we'll be discussing in this talk
  - Demos
    - Blocking state updates
    - Suspense for Data Fetching
    - SuspenseList
    - useTransition
  - More cool stuff
    - Streaming SSR
    - Prerendering with `hidden` attribute
    - useDeferredValue
  - Pitfalls
    - String Refs
    - Legacy Context
    - ReactDOM.findDOMNode
    - unsafe Class Lifecycles
      - unsafe, because the behaviors might not be idempotent, and sometimes lifecycle methods will run multiple times as part of a single "render" cycle
  - Use React.StrictMode to discover problems.
    - Don't impact Production at all.
    - Checks for all of the above
    - Double-invokes `constructor`, `render`, `setState`, and `getDerrivedStateFromProps` to surface any side-effect bugs.
  - Use React Hooks - not as succeptable to side-effect bugs.
