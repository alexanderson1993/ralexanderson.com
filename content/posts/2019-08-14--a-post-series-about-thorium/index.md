This isn't a full blog post - you can expect one later this week.

This is an announcement that I'll be spending the next couple of weeks writing about my development on Thorium. I've been working on the project for over [three years](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/commit/18b975c1e0a6688c70cc93aff439ae765ad5f293), and have learned a thing or two through the process.

And that's the thing - I've learned about a lot more than code. I've learned about working with customers, building a community, and designing a product. As (arguably<sup>1</sup>) the leading expert in Live-Action Roleplay Starship Simulator controls, I've got a lot to share. And while I'm sure I could talk and write for a long time about those things (I've already got a few blog posts planned), I would love to hear from you.

What kinds of things would you like to know about developing spaceship simulator controls? Is there any burning questions that you wish you knew the answer to? Ask me anything.

You can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ralex1993), on [Thorium's Discord Server](https://discord.gg/UvxTQZz), or you can email me directly at [alex@fyreworks.us](mailto:alex@fyreworks.us).

Hope to hear from you soon!

<small><sup>1</sup> Notice how much I hedge myself here. I also should mention that there are a lot of great starship simulator controls out there - [Artemis](https://artemisspaceshipbridge.com/), [Empty Epsilon](https://daid.github.io/EmptyEpsilon/), [Dream Flight Adventures](http://dreamflightadventures.com/), and [InfiniD](https://infinidlearning.com/) all approach starship simulators in a slightly different way and have their own stories to tell.</small>
